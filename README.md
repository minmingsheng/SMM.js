<h1>Why do we use modules?</h1>
<p>Modules allow us manage our code better, which make it is possible to reuse in the future. With modules we can use same name as an object literal that store any variables and functions you want. What the benefit is there is no conflit between two modules share the same name</p>

<h1>Why did you name your module as you did?</h1>
<p>SMM is come from my Chinese name Sheng MinMing. That's it.</p>

<h1>Is there anything that you do not quite understand about modules?</h1>
<p>
	Basic on my understanding, under the uood, every time create module, is to create a literal object essentially.
